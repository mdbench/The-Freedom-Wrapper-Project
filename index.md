This is the Official Freedom Wrapper Project repository GitHub Page. The Freedom Wrapper Project is an Open Source and *Free* Android source code project. It is developed and maintained by Matthew Benchimol.

### The Bottom Line - What we are is what we do:

- A way to get standardized, easy to understand code in the hands of beginners.
- Positive reinforcement for coders of all age groups – make an app in as little as eight steps and start using it right away.
- Take back control: learn to code for yourself and take your content to a larger audience privately or commercially.
- Increase security using simple but effective techniques – check out the project’s readme for more information.
- Open source so you can vet it but free so you can actually use it. No more restrictive licenses.
