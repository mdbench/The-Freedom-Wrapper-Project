### TFWP's stamp of approval:
- Oftentimes, there are Android or other platform coding and security standards that are difficult to track. They use jargon or terms that can alienate consumers from information desparately needed to make decisions. The TFWP stamp of approval was made to cut through the noise. Some coding practices have been standardized but many security and privacy practices are given a backseat. At its core, the TFWP stamp of approval is meant to give people an indication on whether an application is actively protecting its consumers. At a bare minimum, TFWP applications must utilize `webView` in a way that minimizes data sent to other servers (i.e. use an unspecified user agent and prevent all third-party cookies). However, TFWP approved applications must also use **no** embedded application trackers, even for debugging purposes. This is meant to ensure consumers are standardized in how companies or projects approach their consumption needs. It is also to ensure that data is collected in ways where companies can projects can be held responsible for their collection. For instance, web sites are required to make you aware of their data collection efforts in the form of an easily accesible privacy policy or terms of use statement (to name a few). Terms of service and use policies are often agreed to on application platforms as the cost of doing business. Even when websites collect consumer data, many of these services can be blocked on the client side but application embedded trackers cannot be blocked without massive inconvenience or effort.
